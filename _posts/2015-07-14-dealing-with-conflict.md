Teaching students can be fun and difficult. Sometime it takes different approaches to help teach a concept. Sometimes these approaches fail miserably. I've found that failing in teaching increases the anxiety in students. I've found a few things that help when this happens.

The most important thing a student needs is encouragement and support. They are in a new environment with a lot of unknowns. Human nature doesn't like unknown. It's my job as an instructor to help them feel safe is a crazy environment. 

Typical ways to help people feel safe is to:

* Be Consistent 
* Be Clear
* Be Right


## Consistency

Students like consistency. They already don't like the environment so it's a good idea not to introduce any new variables. Choose a project requirement and stick with it. Choose a schedule and stick with it. Choose an X and stick with it.

## Clear

Not only are students learning the content you are teaching, they are also learning the context. Don't forget to explain what it is they are learning along with the context. This includes vocabulary, 'why is this importaint', real-world examples, etc.

## Right

Students look to you as an ultimate source of truth unfortunately. Don't let this go to your head because you are no perfect in your understanding of the material, tools, historical context, delivery, etc. Just be real with them. Explain things how you really understand and explain you don't know everything.
